# JavaScript - I

* The point of these assignments is to take your knowledge of JavaScript and start putting into practice the principles learned throughout JavaScript I.

## Set Up The Project With Git

**Follow these steps to set up and work on your project:**

* [X] Create a forked copy of this project.
* [X] Add your project manager as collaborator on Github.
* [X] Clone your OWN version of the repository (Not Lambda's by mistake!).
* [X] Create a new branch: git checkout -b `<firstName-lastName>`.
* [X] Implement the project on your newly created `<firstName-lastName>` branch, committing changes regularly.
* [X] Push commits: git push origin `<firstName-lastName>`.

**Follow these steps for completing your project.**

* [X] Submit a Pull-Request to merge <firstName-lastName> Branch into master (student's  Repo). **Please don't merge your own pull request**
* [ ] Add your project manager as a reviewer on the pull-request
* [ ] Your project manager will count the project as complete by merging the branch back into master.

## Assignment Description

* Complete all the exercises as described inside each assignment file. *Done*
* Use `console.log()` statements to check to see if your code does what it is supposed to do. *Done*
* To test your `console.log()` statements open up the index.html file found in the assignments folder and use the developer tools to view the console.  *DONE*

**Note:**You could also run `node /assignments/<fileName>` and see what prints in your terminal.

* Once you finish the exercises in each file, commit your code, and push it to your fork.

### Objects

To better understand objects, you really just need to write more of them. The [objects.js](assignments/objects.js) file contains several challenges centered around a theme of interns starting at a new job. The Human Resources team needs information about the new hires. Use your new found object skills answer vital questions for HR.

* Read the instructions found within the file carefully to finish the challenges. *03/26/19: Done with MVP for this section*
* Complete each challenge presented before moving on to Arrays.

### Arrays

The [arrays.js](assignments/arrays.js) assignment takes us through a large data set of used cars.  You have been asked to help a used car business with some customer requests based on their inventory.  Use for loops and arrays to solve their problems.

* Utilize the the array `inventory` to complete your challenges *03/26/19: Done with MVP for this section*
* You are not permitted to use map, reduce, or filter to solve these problems.  Only use a basic for loop.
* Complete each challenge presented before moving on to stretch.

### Arrow Function Syntax

* [X] Arrow Function Syntax - [Check out this awesome guide for ES6 arrow syntax](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/when-and-why-you-should-use-es6-arrow-functions-and-when-you-shouldnt-3d851d7f0b26). You will see more and more arrow functions as you progress deeper into JavaScript. Use the [function-conversion.js](assignments/function-conversion.js) file as a helper challenge to showcase some of the differences between ES5 and ES6 syntax.  
*Done with the MVP and the stretch goal for Arrow syntax section*

### Stretch

* Move on to tomorrow's content and start studying callbacks, write a few of your own to get the hang of it.
* Look at array methods like .map(), .reduce(), .filter(). use them on the data in the arrays assignment to accomplish the same things you did with the ES5 for loop.


## Notes for Standup Meeting, 3/27/19:

##  Breakthroughs/Challenges

### Breakthroughs:
- Scoping is beginning to make a lot more sense. 
- I feel more comfortable with arrow syntax.
- I have a better understanding of let, var, and const. 

### Challenges:
- Arrow notation as it relates to use of the this keyword is still a bit difficult for me to understand, but I think it'll be clearer with practice. 

## What Did I Work On:
- I worked on completing the MVP for JavaScript I and reading the TK material related to JavaScript Fundamentals 2. 

## What Do I Need to Do Tomorrow:
- I would like to finish the second JavaScript project and really get comfortable with Closure in JavaScript.
